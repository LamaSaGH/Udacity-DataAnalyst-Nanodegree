# Udacity DataAnalyst Nanodegree

In this repository contains my projects from the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program, where I explored a variety of real-world datasets and applied data analysis techniques. Through this program, I developed the skills to clean messy data, uncover patterns and insights, and effectively communicate my findings. Each project represents a different aspect of data analysis, from data wrangling to data visualization.


## Projects

 - Project1: Investigate a Dataset
 - Project2: Real World Data Wrangling with Python
 - Project3: Communicate Data Findings
